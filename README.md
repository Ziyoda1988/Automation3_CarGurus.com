      2. Click on Buy Used
      
      3. Verify that the default selected option in Makes dropdown is All Makes (Use Assert methods for all verifications)
      
      4. In Makes dropdown, choose Lamborghini

      9. In the results page, verify that there are 15 search results, excluding the first sponsored
      result: To isolate the 15 results, excluding the first sponsored one, you can use a custom xpath which excludes the first result. For example:
    ////a[@data-cg-ft='car-blade-link'][not(contains(@href, 'FEATURED'))] (find all <a> elements that have a common data-cg-ft attribute 'car-blade-link' (matche 16 results) and whose href attribute does not contain text 'FEATURED'
        List<WebElement> searchResults = driver.findElements(By.xpath("//a[@data-cg-ft='car-blade-link'][not(contains(@href, 'FEATURED'))]"));
       
      10. Verify that all 15 result's title text contains "Lamborghini Gallardo
       
      11. From the dropdown on the left corner choose “Lowest price first” option and verify that
    all 15 results are sorted from lowest to highest. You should exclude the first result since
    it will not be a part of sorting logic.
    To verify correct sorting, collect all 15 prices into a list, create a copy of it and sort in
    ascending order and check the equality of the sorted copy with the original

      
      12. From the dropdown menu, choose “Highest mileage first” option and verify that all 15
    results are sorted from highest to lowest. You should exclude the first result since it will
    not be a part of sorting logic

      13. On the left menu, click on Coupe AWD checkbox and verify that all results on the page
    contains “Coupe AWD”

      14. Click on the last result (get the last result dynamically, i.e., your code should click on the
    last result regardless of how many results are there
       
      15. Once you are in the result details page go back to the results page and verify that the
    clicked result has “Viewed” text on it
       


   *** Remember: 90% of the exceptions and issues that you encounter can be resolved by
       synchronizing your code, i.e., by observing what is your code trying to do and what is
       actually happening on the UI and adjust your code by adding necessary waits. Make sure
       to set an implicit wait and use Thread.sleep() as needed.
